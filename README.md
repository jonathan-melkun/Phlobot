# Phlobot
## MakeNJIT Hardware Hackathon First Place Project

Within 24 hours, worked in a team of 3 to design and manufacture a low-cost automated phlebotomy robot out of laser cut MDF for use in developing countries or in times of doctor shortages.
3 axis control system was driven with 2 stepper motors on a rack and pinion to position the needle in the horizontal plane and a micro servo to actuate the needle tip.
Computer vision script written in Python was used with an iPhone camera to locate the “vein” and position the needle accordingly.
